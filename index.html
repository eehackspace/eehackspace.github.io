						<h2>What is a Hackspace?</h2>
						<p>A lot of negative connotations surround the word "hack", but hacking is the repurposing and learning
							of things.  A hackspace is a shared space for people who mess around with technology 
							for fun. By creating a shared space to do this, we provide access to 
							better facilities than we could each have at home, as well as opportunities 
							to collaborate, learn, and socialise.</p>
						<h2>East Essex Hackspace</h2>
						<p>East Essex Hackspace has been setup in an old sports pavilion in Hawkwell.  We have a metal & wood workshop, computer
							lab, wet lab for brewing & photography, laser room and social/lecture space.

						<h2>Join us!</h2>
						<p>It's suggested you come to an open night (we are planning Thursdays) where you can come and see what people have been working on and check out the facilities before jumping into membership.  That said, we work on the basis of a £5 membership fee and a £10pcm subscripion for access to the workshops.  Some facilities are charged by the hour (like the 3D printers) or require additional contributions (like money towards CO2 and Argon).</p>

							<h3>East Essex Hackspace</h3>
							<p>EEH was incorporated in 2019, but started in 2018.  Converted to Charity in 2020.  Originally the pavilion we are now based at had been empty for 8 years and the local U3A group had viewed the space as potentially being a good location to meet, but too large and poorly maintained for them to take over.  It made sense for the hackspace to take it on - the lack of windows increased security, and the changing room layout perfect for individual workshops.  The rennovations took over three months of weekend working, with help from the local council, several companies and grant bodies.</p>
