							<h2>March 2020</h2>
						</header>
						<p>It will come as no surprise to us now, that the UK was very unprepared for the effects of COVID-19.</p>
						<p>Prusa (a well known 3D printing company) quickly organised a response, publishing a protective face shield design you could 3D print in around 4 hours at the recommended settings</p>
						<p>We printed... 5.  It took a long time.</p>
						<p>Some in the community managed to get the print time down from 4hrs to 1hr.
						<p>Nottinghackspace / Smoke and Mirrors produced a laser cut design.  We tweaked (as our heads seemed to be bigger!) and optimised it for the available sized Polypropylene we could cut.  We could cut about 20 an hour on a small bed cutter</p> 
						<hr />
						<h3>Crowdfunded!</h3>
						<p>We decided on the 2nd night of cutting to launch a campaign in the local area to try and get enough money to buy a much larger bed cheap chinese cutter and within a day, had hit our goal.  But COVID-19 had other plans.</p>
						<p>Unbenownst to us, customs had cut down on "non essential" imports.  Unwittingly, they were also stopping the very people trying to help the health service.  So we were back to the crowdfunding to try and buy a cutter in the UK</p>
						<p>By this point, we recieved two pleasant pieces of news, first, we had recieved a private donation of almost £3,000 pushing us to £6,000 for the cutter and some for materials AND someone from the East London Inventors Club offered us a 2nd A3 cutter.</p>
						<p>Pretty much every company was out of stock.  After a day of ringing round (lets face it, it's embarrising to have raised all the money and not be able to help!) we found a company which not only had them in stock, but were willing to ship it down to us from Birmingham.</p>
						<p>The laser was dropped off, setup and we started cutting.  Next morning, the cutter stopped dead.</p>
						<p>Turned out the tube had died. But brilliantly, the company who shipped it down, came down the same day with replacement tubes and swapped it all over.  We were up again the next day.</p>
						<p>By this point, we'd already churned out about 3,000 face shields for the NHS.  By the time we'd passed the peak, we were up to 9,000 face shields.</p>

							<h3>East Essex Hackspace</h3>
							<p>EEH was incorporated in 2019, but started in 2018.  Converted to Charity in 2020.  Originally the pavilion we are now based at had been empty for 8 years and the local U3A group had viewed the space as potentially being a good location to meet, but too large and poorly maintained for them to take over.  It made sense for the hackspace to take it on - the lack of windows increased security, and the changing room layout perfect for individual workshops.  The rennovations took over three months of weekend working, with help from the local council, several companies and grant bodies.</p>
